    <p>	Ranunculus is a genus of flowering plants, better known as the <b>buttercup family.</b> This genus includes several common plants, such as creeping buttercup and meadow buttercup. While there are many wild varieties, certain species in this genus are popular garden choices.</p>
    <p>Of these, the <b>Persian Buttercup</b>, or <i>Ranunculus Asiaticus</i>, is the most prolific. It has been cultivated to be a wide variety of colors and its delicate, papery petals catch the eye of florists and hobbyists alike. It is showy enough to be the main star of most arrangements itâ€™s in.</p>
