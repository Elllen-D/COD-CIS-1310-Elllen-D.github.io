    <hr>
    <p>	Ranunculus is a genus of flowering plants, better known as the <b>buttercup family.</b> This genus includes several common plants, such as creeping buttercup and meadow buttercup. While there are many wild varieties, certain species in this genus are popular garden choices.</p>
    <p>Of these, the <b>Persian Buttercup</b>, or <i>Ranunculus Asiaticus</i>, is the most prolific. It has been cultivated to be a wide variety of colors and its delicate, papery petals catch the eye of florists and hobbyists alike. It is showy enough to be the main star of most arrangements it’s in.</p>
